This repository contains the assignment of Calculator.

You can find following commits here:
1) In the first commit, there are tests and skeletons of classes
2) In the second commit, there are implemented classes, that can pass all test
3) In the third commit, there are refactorized classes & added comments
4) The last commit includes this README :)
I have done everything in the master, since there was no reason to make another branch

How to install the app:
The app works on Linux and not on Windows (since in some tests, there are platform dependant pathways, thank Bill for \ instead of /).
Clone this github repository into your local folder and run maven:

$ git clone https://github.com/jiraspe2/calculator
$ cd calculator
$ mvn package

There are 9 test, all of the should be passed.

If you want to run your app, type (in the root directory):
$ java -cp target/calculator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar name_of_the_file

There are 3 tests files included, so you can try i.e.:
$ java -cp target/calculator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar calculator.Calculator src/test/resources/test3

And that is pretty much all :0)
